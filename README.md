# Roam!

## This is my Capstone project for the Web Development Bootcamp at [neuefische GmbH](https://www.neuefische.de)

## Description - This is Roam!

You have some spare time, a few days off and don't know what to do? Find new interesting activities, filter them by your interests and available time and experience something new! If you want something completely New, Roam! got you covered as well! Just open Roam!Map and pick an activity close to you!
